A bunch of useless training code
I am learning C# on my own using the various tutorials and lectures published online.
Interested in learning SQL databases as well.

TextGame is a console clone of pokemon red.
Currently have a battle demo with types for monsters, moves, characters, effects, and various stats.

Need to add inventory, item use during battle, and database of all game object templates.


The rest of the files are useless and abandoned test code.

Discord: C-Vac#8994, please tell me how shit my code is so I can learn more!
